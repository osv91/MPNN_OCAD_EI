1. First, please download pre-trained models from:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jysi7R0NLoEelnczUzfwtxq0_py7-m2T?usp=sharing
2. To make predictions it is needed to run Predictor.ipynb notebook with list of smiles (test.smi)
3. To perform cross-validation OCAD_MPNN_5fold_CV.ipynb should be run. OCAD sdf file should be located to the main folder
4. For each CV fold separate run of OCAD_MPNN_5fold_CV.ipynb is needed (to release GPU memory)
